# Threads Reference

[← Back to Documentation](https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/pm_threads/blob/main/Documentation.md)

## `(active thread)` -> Thread
Returns the currently active thread.

This is always the thread that contains the block, because it is impossible to run this block without it being in the active thread.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Wraps `vm.runtime.sequencer.activeThread`.
</details>

## `(null thread)` -> Thread
Returns the null thread.

This represents a thread that failed to load or doesn't exist. It has an ID of `undefined`. This thread is also used when the wrong type is inserted into a thread input.

## `(thread at (INDEX v))` -> Thread
Returns the thread that is at `INDEX` in the running threads list. If `INDEX` is 0, returns the last thread.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Pulls from the `vm.runtime.threads` array.
</details>

## `(target of [THREAD])` -> Target
Returns the target that is running / ran `THREAD`.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Wraps the `target` key from the raw thread object.
</details>

## `(id of [THREAD])` -> String
Returns a unique identifier for `THREAD`. This ID is generated by the extension and is not used in the PenguinMod engine.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns the custom `soupThreadId` key from the raw thread object.
</details>

## `(status of [THREAD])` -> Number
Returns the current status code of `THREAD`. These are the possible values:

| Status | Display name         | Description                                                  |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | Running              | The default status of a thread.[^1]                          |
| 1      | Waiting for promise  | Behavior unknown                                             |
| 2      | Yielded              | Behavior unknown                                             |
| 3      | Yielded for one tick | Behavior unknown                                             |
| 4      | Completed            | The thread is "dead", i.e. it will never run code again.[^1] |
| 5      | Suspended            | Behavior unknown                                             |

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns the `status` key from the raw thread object.
</details>

## `<[THREADONE] is [THREADTWO]>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if the IDs of the threads match, otherwise returns `false`.

Note that the `<[] = []>` block in Operators will not work for this, as that block compares the stringified value.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Uses `soupThreadId` to compare the threads.
</details>

## `<[VALUE] is a thread?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `VALUE` is a thread, otherwise returns `false`.

## `<[THREAD] is null?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `THREAD` is the null thread.

## `<[THREAD] is alive?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `THREAD` is alive, i.e. it is not finished.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns `true` if the raw thread is in the `vm.runtime.threads` array.
</details>

## `<[THREAD] exited naturally?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `THREAD` is dead, but was not killed, i.e. it exited of its own accord.[^2]

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns `true` if:
  - The raw thread is not in the `vm.runtime.threads` array (therefore it is dead).
  - The raw thread's `isKilled` key is `false`.
  - The raw thead's `status` key is 4 (completed). This catches the `stop [all v]` case in which killed threads have `isKilled` set to `false` and `status` unchanged.
</details>

## `<[THREAD] was killed?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `THREAD` exited due to an external cause.[^2]

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns `true` if:
  - The raw thread is not in the `vm.runtime.threads` array (therefore it is dead).
  - Either:
    - The raw thread's `isKilled` key is `true`.
    - The raw thead's `status` key is not 4 (completed). This catches the `stop [all v]` case in which killed threads have `isKilled` set to `false` and `status` unchanged.
</details>

## `<[THREAD] was started by clicking in the editor?>` -> Boolean
Returns `true` if `THREAD` was started by manually clicking a stack in the code editor.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Returns the `stackClick` key from the raw thread object.
</details>

---

## `(running threads)` -> Array\[Thread\]
Returns all threads that are currently alive in their execution order.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Wraps the `vm.runtime.threads` array.
</details>

## `(position of [THREAD])` -> Number
Returns the index of `THREAD` in the list of alive threads.

<details>
  <summary>Internal behavior</summary>
  
  Uses `soupThreadId` to compare `THREAD` to the threads in the `vm.runtime.threads` array, and returns the index if a match is found.
</details>



[^1]: Status is not a reliable indicator for whether a thread is alive. To reliably check if a thread is alive, instead you should use [`<[THREAD] is alive?>`](#thread-is-alive---boolean). This is because in many cases when a thread is stopped, it will enter limbo. Limbo is when a dead thread's status does not get set to 4. Some known cases where a thread enters limbo:
    - When the &nbsp;<img alt="blue flag" style="height: 1em;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-Home/refs/heads/main/static/stage_controls/gradient/flag.svg"> blue flag is clicked, all previously running threads will enter limbo.
    - When the &nbsp;<img alt="stop sign" style="height: 1em;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PenguinMod/PenguinMod-Home/refs/heads/main/static/stage_controls/gradient/stop.svg"> stop sign is clicked, all previously running threads will enter limbo.
    - When a stack restarts because its hat is triggered again, the old thread enters limbo.

[^2]: There are some exceptions where a thread is considered "killed" even though it caused its own termination:
    - When a thread runs `stop [all v]`, it is considered killed.
    - When `stop (SPRITE v)` is run, all threads running as `SPRITE` are considered killed, even if they caused it.
    - When a clone is deleted, all threads running as that clone are considered killed, even if they caused the deletion.
